# 👋 Hi there! I'm Abigail Amonett

I'm a recent graduate in Information Systems from Carnegie Mellon University, passionate about making useful, accessible, and delightful tech.

I love collaborating, and some of my recent favorite projects are:
- [**Dr. Row's 555**](https://dr-rows-555.com/) – a guided meditation app for healthcare and wellness leader Dr. Rowena Pingul-Ravano.
- [**SiiV**](https://ajaphid.github.io/siiv/) – a custom storefront for a multi-medium artist.

Most recently, I've been working with **React** and **TypeScript**, but I love learning new skills and am working on a **Python** project involving data analysis and visualization.
